Created on: 9/3/2018

Purpose: This script will go through an entire ArcGIS Online Organization or a Portal Organization and look through all of the Web Maps. Then, this script will check the all of the urls of all of the map services within each Web Map to determine if they are valid. If they are not valid, it will write the results to a csv file so they can be taken care of. The csv file can then be used to aid the administrator in the cleanup of the map services with invalid urls. This is a Jupyter Notebook written using the ArcGIS Python API.
